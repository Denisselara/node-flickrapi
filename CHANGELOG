v0.2.26
  * Flickr API proxying, so that your app can use query flickr
    server side and send the response back over your own API
    url. Because client-side Flickr-API calls cannot be signed
    securely.

  * client side improvment: much smaller production library,
    acceptably sized dev library.
  * README documentation ammended for client-side library use.

  * also compiles to client-side library now, with a precompiled
    library in the ./browser directory.

v0.2.21

  * added collection icon image mirroring, so you don't need
    to create your own pinhead collages.

v0.2.16
  * "on downsync complete" callback added

v0.2.14
  * downsync will now prune entries that you removed from Flickr,
    but still have in your mirror, but only when the `downsync`
    function is called with the option second `removeDeleted`
    parameter set to `true`.

v0.2.11
  * updated the progress package. It's now well-behaved on OSX.

v0.2.9
  * downsync now updates entries on disk that were updated on Flickr
    since the last downsync, rather than requiring you delete your
    ia directory and redownloading all the .json data.

v0.2.8
  * photos are correctly sorted in photosets

v0.2.6
  * comments and contexts are cross-referenced into photos

v0.2.5

  * app permissions can be passed during the `authenticate` call,
    defaulting to "read".
